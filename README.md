I believe that learning never ends and i am not rigid to learning but flexibility to learn is my strength.

I am a Network Administrator, well verse with nitty-gritty of Network configurations and implementing Routing protocols like:
Stactic Routing,
Float Route,
Dynamic Routing protocols like :
OSPF, RIP, RIPv2, and EIGRP etc.
In addendum, i am also a master of IP config, standard and extended ACLs, enabling both half and full duplex with channel speed.
Am verse in Switching configurations like Port security, native VLANs configurations etc.

With the advantageous psychology knowledge and Usable Security knowledge i have, i implement networks that brings joy to the users because the users are incoporated along with the network architecture and design as to provide them with a network of maximum security and efficient usability to meet up the criteria for mental model.

I love to explore the fundamentals of networks in other to gain full knowledge of how each and every protocol/ interface works and how packets are sent in the networks, how each routing protocol communicate with each other, this obsession has lead to exploring the basic fundamental logic of networking. 

I am a good team player with resolve and discipline, and i am not rigid to learning as learning is my everyday hobby.

My technical skills are: 
✅ Networking.
✅ Usable Security.
✅ Javascript.
✅ HTML.
✅ CSS.
✅ and python.
